#  Practice File Handling (Read, Write, Delete, Update, and Search)

import os

# 1. Writing to a file
def write_to_file(filename, content):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)
    print(f"Content written to {filename}")

# 2. Reading from a file
def read_from_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            print(file.read())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"{filename} not found!")

# 3. Appending to a file
def append_to_file(filename, content):
    with open(filename, 'a') as file:
        file.write(content)
    print(f"Content appended to {filename}")

# 4. Searching in a file
def search_in_file(filename, keyword):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
            for i, line in enumerate(lines, start=1):
                if keyword in line:
                    print(f"Keyword '{keyword}' found on line {i}: {line.strip()}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"{filename} not found!")

# 5. Deleting a file
def delete_file(filename):
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        os.remove(filename)
        print(f"{filename} has been deleted.")
    else:
        print(f"{filename} does not exist.")

# Demonstration
file_name = "example.txt"

# Writing to the file
write_to_file(file_name, "Hello, this is a test file.\nThis is the second line.\n")

# Reading from the file
read_from_file(file_name)

# Appending to the file
append_to_file(file_name, "This is an appended line.\n")

# Searching in the file
search_in_file(file_name, "test")

# Deleting the file
delete_file(file_name)
