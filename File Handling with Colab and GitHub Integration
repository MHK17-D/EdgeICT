#  File Handling with Colab and GitHub Integration



# 1. File Handling Operations
import os

def create_and_write_file(filename, content):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)
    print(f"File '{filename}' created and written successfully.")

def read_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            print(file.read())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File '{filename}' not found.")

def append_to_file(filename, content):
    with open(filename, 'a') as file:
        file.write(content)
    print(f"Content appended to '{filename}'.")

def delete_file(filename):
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        os.remove(filename)
        print(f"File '{filename}' deleted.")
    else:
        print(f"File '{filename}' does not exist.")

# 2. Demonstration of File Operations
file_name = "colab_example.txt"

# Create and write to the file
create_and_write_file(file_name, "This is a test file created in Google Colab.\n")

# Read the file
read_file(file_name)

# Append to the file
append_to_file(file_name, "This is additional content appended in Google Colab.\n")

# Read the file again
read_file(file_name)

# Delete the file
delete_file(file_name)

# 3. Instructions for GitHub Integration
print("\nTo save your code to GitHub:")
print("1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com.")
print("2. Open this notebook in Colab.")
print("3. Save this notebook to your GitHub repository using 'File > Save a copy in GitHub'.")
print("4. Provide the URL of the saved notebook as your submission.")
